# A Unique Text Cipher and Decipher Tool

This is a Python-based project designed to encrypt and decrypt text using a unique cipher method called the 'Decimal Letter Cipher,' developed indigenously by me. This handcrafted tool provides a simple yet effective way to secure your messages. Whether you're interested in basic cryptography or just want to explore a new way to protect your text, this project offers an intriguing solution.

## How This Idea Clicked Me?

The idea for this project came from a fascination with cryptography and a desire to create something personal and unique. While many cipher methods are available publicly, I wanted to design a method that was entirely my own. After some experimentation, I developed a cipher technique that encodes each letter with a specific numerical pattern, as listed in the [Cipher Sheet](#cipher-sheet) below. This project allows you to easily cipher or decipher text, making it a fun and educational tool for anyone interested in the art of encryption.
